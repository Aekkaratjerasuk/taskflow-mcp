## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it through your AI assistant. Hereâ€™s how to utilize the features:

### Creating Tasks

To create a new task, send a request to the server with the task details. The server will respond with a unique task ID.

### Adding Subtasks

You can add subtasks to any existing task by specifying the parent task ID. This helps in organizing tasks better.

### Managing Dependencies

Define dependencies between tasks to ensure they execute in the correct order. The server will handle the logic for you.

### Adding Notes

Attach notes to any task for additional context. This is useful for providing background information or instructions.

### User Approval

Before a task proceeds, the server will prompt for user approval. This ensures that the user is always in control.
